# escamboVirtualApplication

This project was designed and developed by Pedro Arvellos, Joao Pedro and Jos√© Mauricio and has as foundation the exchange of products which no longer are interisting to the owner. In other words, this system is a Web Application committed to the fomentation of the old practice of foster, this way, users trade products which are uninteresting for them to products which they're eager to get. This application esteems also the environment, as it contributes to the minimization of the disposal practice.  

This application uses the build management tool Maven and has its back-end developed in Java (as a back-end framework it was used Spring MVC). Other frameworks were also used in the front-end, such as Angular 1 and Materialize.
